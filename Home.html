        <h1>Golden State Warriors</h1>
         <h2>(Why They Won't Lose) </h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction </h3>
        <p>Golden State is in a great position for the next upcoming season
        they have some of the best guys in the N.B.A today and nobody can handle
        the punch they pack. In a way they have actually broken the N.B.A, because
        teams have no idea what to do against them. Their offense can be crazy,
        nonstop action for them outside and if you guard them outside they'll get 
        easy layups inside. It dosn't stop at the amazing offense either ,the
        Warriors defense is just as good as their offense. Instead of running a 
        traditional defense they can run no big man and rely on speed and steals 
        instead of blocks and rebounds. Besides evn if you shut down their starting 
        lineup, their bench is stacked too.
        </p>
        <h3> Their Too Good </h3>
       <p> Golden State has four all stars, is that even fair? Its crazy, the all
        star game is basically Golden State v.s The Eastern Conference. The team 
        is so good it makes the game uninteresting to watch considering you know 
        whats going to happen at this point.They will contiue
        to dominate the N.B.A unless some changes are made.</p>
